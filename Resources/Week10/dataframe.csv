This project is actually a redesign of an existing client website. The client website was designed
on Java Server Pages (JSP) and our aim was to change it into a more dynamic web page using
Adobe Flex. At first we changed the home page screen of the client website. After the successful
completion of that we incorporated flex in to the account section also. This data which is obtained
from DataBase is taken by the flex using a remote procedure call and the data is shown to the
user. With the use of Advanced Data Grids, Charts(including Bar and Pie Charts) the site increased
the readability and understandability of the users who were previously using the pages on java
server pages. This site developed by us won the IMC (Interactive Media Council)'s outstanding

Description: Development of Basel II Application, Basel II is the second of the Basel Accords,
which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision. The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to
create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about
how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational
risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk
and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves
appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.

The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital
requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage
(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are
Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan
approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.

➢ This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window
A*(MAWA*), which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-
bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the
memory-bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations.
Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented.
Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show
the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.

Project Details

UG PROJECT TITLE: Memory Bounded Anytime Heuristic Search A* Algorithm

➢ This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window A*
(MAWA*), which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-bounded
anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory-
bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations.
Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented.
Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show
the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.

DESCRIPTION
• IPv6, formerly named IPng (next generation), is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP). IP
is a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks
• Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services IPv4 users can move to IPv6 and receive services such
as end-to-end security, quality of service (QoS), and globally unique addresses. The IPv6 address
space reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing
by border routers at network edges.
• Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6
addresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally,
and Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled
• The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP
addresses.
• Mainly involves to checks the functionality of all waas features to work with v6 addressing

DESCRIPTION
• Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) is a Cisco Systems technology that improves the
performance of applications on a wide area network (WAN). WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area
File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at
LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based
applications on a given network.
• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work
together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt



to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so
that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.
• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to
optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized
• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform
check.

BIRT Reports
BTRAMR0001SYSER.rptdesign (Work order report):
• My client was using default BTRAMR2 Work order reports. They also use a different work order
report in Maximo V4 and V6. The earlier used report have many drawbacks such as

No Flexibility for modification since it is used by many divisions
Empty boxes, lot of missing information
Not align with Systems objectives and processes
Historical context on the asset is missing
Esthetical issues: Font too small, input fields not instinctive
No bar coding used
• The outcome of this report is a form to support technician's work and regulation and give
them simplicity to input information. It covers the full spectra of requirements of System Services
divisions.
• This report is site specific one and it will display the WO details along with its task WOs and
failure reporting information.
• Each site is having their own logo. This current report will display the logo based on site.
• It was implemented in V7.1 only. In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page
numbers (i.e., while displaying multiple WOs, for each new WO page number will not be reset
automatically) . I have implemented this option in this report.
• Language Translation was used for this report in German and French
• I did not use IBM templates for this report. I have customized our own template in this report.

BTRAMR0009.rptdesign (Availability Report):

• This particular report relates to the requirement of the business to be able to create a
Availability Graph based on selected Train Assets, a timeframe and selected work types / work
order parameters.
• Availability can be calculated based on a Fleet or a single Train. The business requirement is to
be able to select this base as needed to suit the project or view needed at that time.

BTRAMR0027.rptdesign (Card Stock Report):
Existing report functionality:
• Technician requiring a part will take the component in its bin along with an Inventory Card. The
technician reports the consumption at the exit of the storeroom on the Kiosk computer where
he scans its Work Order and the Inventory Card in the application Issue and Transfer of Maximo.
When we rebuild something internally, the technician will bring the new assembly in store, grab
the Inventory Card and he will report the return in store against the rebuilt Work order.
Objectives:
• Created a card stock report in order to match the existing Inventory Card tool developed by
Systems.
• Increase reporting of consumption



• Redefine the process of cycle count (80% efficiency in Systems)
• The report will be based on inventory information and will introduce the notion of real time to
increase precision

BTRAMR0001SBB.rptdesign (Report Change):
• The report BTRAMR0001SBB was developed for the European project. It is based on the
BTRAMR0001MLM report and currently uses only launch option 2 and 3 of the BTRAMR0001MLM
report. The client requested to have option 1 (type=1) of the BTRAMR0001MLM implemented in
the BTRAMR0001SBB report as well as the translation of the labels from French to English.
Objectives:
• To have define the type=1, report definition for BTRAMR0001SBB
• To have the labels translated from French to English

BTRAMR0002.rptdesign (Systems Purchase Requisition Report):

• The current PR report does not have bar-coding feature and is formatted too small. This is an
operational report; it will be used in real time.
• Have a common and standardized PR report across all Systems services sites with the support
of bar-coding

Incident Management Solution report:
• The report displays the overall ticket progress. It shows count of tickets raised and assigned to
both Infosys and Client queue. We can view the total no. of tickets raised for various application
groups such as Maximo, Kronos and BIEM. It also further categories the ticket count based on
ticket priority and the status. This helps in analyzing the data from ticketing tool.
• There might be cases where different teams work on the tickets raised. This reports helps to
analyses the team wise ticket count. We can there by monitor the performance of various teams.
• This report displays the number of Incidents and Service Requests logged in each month. Also
it shows total tickets (Incidents + Service requests) logged in each month.
• This Report shows the number of tickets logged per country and it has been grouped month
wise for various application groups such as Maximo, Kronos and BIEM within a date range.

"Girish Acharya
Technical Architect & Sr. Software Engineer

Pune, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Girish-Acharya/6757f94ee9f4ec23

I would like to describe myself as a hard-core software engineer and technical architect
passionate for technology and someone who loves to take challenges head-on. I have been using
combined engineering principles wherein I was responsible for designing, developing, testing,
deploying and monitoring highly scalable distributed applications and services. 

While I have always been working using Microsoft technologies, I got chance to work for Microsoft
in as a full-time employee last year. My focus as part of this role was as a Dev Ops/Site Reliability
Engineer. The main requirement of this role was to keep-lights-on in all data centers for Windows
Developer Center. While Service Engineering aspect was the main requirement, I used my
technical architect and software tools for inside-out and outside-in monitoring and telemetry. 

As a technical architect, I have worked in Accenture for about 7+ years. My role @ Microsoft
account was to demonstrate technical leadership, design technical architecture, propose
and introduce standard design and architectural patterns and practices, incorporate new
requirements and feedbacks from client and execute multiple quick prototypes. As part of this
role – I architected Microsoft IT’s (MSIT) biggest Platform As A Service (PaaS) solution back in
the days.

I have executed multiple client facing projects wherein I was responsible for designing,
architecting the compute, storage, application and deployment architecture. I have experience
in designing and architecting systems for Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCP/
DR strategies). I have designed and architected solutions for “Testing in production”. I have
experience in designing and architecting for extremely high scale (~ 3 billion requests/day). I
have designed and implemented auto healing, smooth traffic routing and eventual consistency
in multiple client facing projects. 

I am in the Information Technology industry since 2001 working for various software organizations
in India for 4 years till I joined Accenture in 2006. I came to USA in 2010 and was working as
consultant for Microsoft. I joined Microsoft in May 2015 as a full-time employee. I earned my
Electronics Engineering degree in year 2000, Diploma in Advance Computing degree in year 2001
and completed Microsoft Certified Professional Developer and Enterprise Architect certification
(MCPDEA) in year 2007. I am also Microsoft Azure Certified Developer and Architect. 

I am frequent community contributor. I blog at http://girishthegeek.wordpress.com/ 

I have worked and published an asset called Framework for Ops Team considering Windows Azure
and it was very well received by the clients and appreciated by the managers.

I wrote a white paper related to AppFabric Service Bus which got published in MSDN.

DOPRA is the platform for telecom products. It is a proprietary platform and has company internal
customers. It has main two planes, system management and system service planes and several
sub modules.
I have successfully worked on the following modules.

Module - MML INI Parser Tool
MML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments
This Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands. INI Parsing tool is a tool
which accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File
respectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.
Involved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.



Module - Man Machine Language
MML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server
architecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.
It receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process
it. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back
to the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization
Management, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,
LOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.
Involved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and
vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.

Configuration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function
is to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration
tool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication
mechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the
functionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands
can be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.
Configuration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be
loaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static
configuration data.
Involved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and
vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.
